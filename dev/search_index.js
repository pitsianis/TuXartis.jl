The highlighted line segments are translated to the corresponding edge points in the corresponding edge embedding space.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: ) A pictorial introduction of the twin-embedding method and its key advantages with a stick sculpture comprised of 105 sticks and 50 joins. From left to right: (a) A non-planar graph for the sculpture with n = 50 nodes and m = 105 edges; (b) The (m + n) × (m + n) twin-embedding adjacency matrix; (c) A 2D twin-embedding of the graph. (c-1) The vertex points marked in blue and the edge points in red are interspersed. A blue vertex point has its adjacent vertex points in blue close by and also has its incident edges in red nearby. (c-2) The blue vertex points and the red edge points are well matched, manifesting the effect of self-assignment by the twin embedding. (c-3) The red point clusters indicate densely bundled edges at high-degree vertices. (d) The vertex embedding split from the twin embedding. Without external regulation, the line segments for the edges are well laid out and less prone to co-linear or overly crossing placements, as an evidence of the autonomous self-regulation induced by the twin-embedding method.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: Test caption)  The subnetwork of vasculature cells from the Tabula Sapiens biological network data in a 2D vertex vector/point embedding space (the left plot) and a 2D edge vector/point embedding space (the middle plot), obtained by the twin-embedding method introduced in this paper. The right plot displays the twin-embedding matrix of (1). The subnetwork G has n = 16,037 nodes for the cells and m = 158,885 edges.The line graph Gl has 6,384,850 edges. In the vertex embedding, the cell/vertex points are color-coded by the cell types, there are 14 cell types or classes. In the edge embedding, any point for an intra-class edge is colored by the same cell class color; any point for an inter-class edge is colored in black. As the edge points are nearly 10 times denser, the edge-point marker size is made a quarter of the vertex-point marker size. The vertex point cloud and the edge point cloud are superbly aligned in their global configurations as well in their class substructures.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: ) A kNN graph (k=16) for the image data MNIST-DIGITS in a 2D vertex embedding space. The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Every point in the embedding space represents a digit image, colored by its digit class cluster. Each cluster is textured by sampled digit images, which are visible upon zoom-in. The clusters are spatially well separated. This advanced function is provided by tuXartis.","category":"page"}]
