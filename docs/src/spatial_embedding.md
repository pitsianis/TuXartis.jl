# Spatial embedding 
(low-dimensional real-valued vector representation) 

  * Embedding types
    + vertex embedding/vector representation
    + edge embedding
       - induced by vertex embedding
       - generated via line graph
       - vertex-edge twin-embedding
         ( a unification and a generalization ) 

  * Embedding properties (basic) 
    + adjacent vertices are closer to each other in the real-valued vector space
    + incident edges are closer to each other in he real-valued vector space 
      
  * Embedding methods
     + by force
     + via graph Laplacian
     + by SG-t-SNE
     + (add more)
